## Question:

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (`total_amt_usd / total`) for the order.  
However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity exceeds 100**.  
Your final table should have **3 columns**:  
- Region name  
- Account name  
- Unit price  

To avoid a division by zero error, it's helpful to add **`0.01` to the denominator**, like so:  
`total_amt_usd / (total + 0.01)`

## Answer:

```sql

SELECT 
    r.name AS region, 
    a.name AS accountname, 
    o.total_amt_usd / (o.total + 0.01) AS unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
  ON r.id = s.region_id
JOIN accounts a 
  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN orders o 
  ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE standard_qty > 100 
  AND poster_qty > 50;
```



### Question 15 

Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the `web_events` table for each region.  
Your final table should have **three columns**:  
- the **region name**,  
- the **channel**, and  
- the **number of occurrences**.  

Order your table with the **highest number of occurrences first**.

---

### Answer:

```sql
SELECT r.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) AS num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
  ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
  ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;
```

### Question 16 

What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd. Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.

---

### Answer:

```sql
SELECT a.name, MIN(total_amt_usd) smallest_order
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY smallest_order;

```
###  Question 16

In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?


``` sql 

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.occurred_at) ord_date, SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o 
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;


```

### Question 17 

 This time, create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time with no date truncation. 
 Your final table should have two columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.

###Answer: 

```sql

SELECT standard_amt_usd,
SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (partition by date_trunc('month',occurred_at ) ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders

```

### Question  18 

Use the accounts table to create first and last name columns that hold the first and last names for the primary_poc.


```sql

select 
 primary_poc,
 left(primary_poc, POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as firstname,
 right(primary_poc, length(primary_poc)-POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as lastname
                     
from  accounts 

```


### Question 19 
Now see if you can do the same thing for every rep name in the sales_reps table. Again provide first and last name columns.


```sql
select 
 name ,
 left(name, POSITION (' ' in  name ))as firstname,
 right(name, length(name)-POSITION (' ' in  name ))as lastname
                     
from  sales_reps 
```
### Question 20 

Each company in the accounts table wants to create an email address for each primary_poc. The email address should be the first name of the primary_poc . last name primary_poc @ company name .com.



```sql
with  t1 as 
( 
 select 
 name ,
 left(primary_poc, POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as firstname,
 right(primary_poc, length(primary_poc)-POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as lastname
                     
from  accounts  

)
      
select 
  CONCAT(firstname,'.',lastname,'@',Replace(name, ' ', ''),'.com' ) as email 
  from t1 
       
```
)

### Question 18 

Q.

	Find the best-selling item for each month (no need to separate months by year) where the biggest total invoice was paid.  
	The best-selling item is calculated using the formula (unitprice * quantity ). Output the description of the item along with the amount paid. 

Your output should include:

	the month (use DATE_TRUNC('month', invoicedate)),
	the description of the best-selling item, 
	and the total amount paid.

### Question 19 

 Email Activity Rank Problem

 Find the email activity rank for each user. Email activity rank is defined by the total number of emails sent. The user with the highest number of emails sent will have a rank of 1. and so on. Output the user, total emails, and their activity rank. Order records by the total emails in descending order. Sort users with the same number of emails in alphabetical order.
In your rankings, return a unique value(i.e a unique rank) even if multiple users have the same number of emails. For tie breaker use alphabetical order of the user usernames. 

---

## Table Schema

| Column Name | Data Type |
|-------------|-----------|
| id          | int       |
| from_user   | varchar   |
| to_user     | varchar   |
| day         | int       |

```sql

Select from_user  as user, 
count(from_user) as email sent, 
ROW_NUMBER(order by  count(from_user) desc , from id asc) as activity_rank
group by  id 
order by count(from_user) desc 

```

#### Note : One can use Rank dense Rank and also Row_number will give same number of output because   we are using a tie breaker which is order of the user username: if there were not a tie break then you cannot use Rank and Dense rank because this  will give you non- unique values 


 #### Q.20  SQL Challenge: Successful Multiple Purchases in the Last 1 Month


**Find customers with successful multiple purchases in the last 1 month.**  
- A purchase is considered **successful** if it is **not returned within 1 week of purchase** (i.e., either return_date is NULL or return_date > purchase_date + 7 days).

##  Table: `purchases`

| purchase_id | customer_id | purchase_date | return_date |

| 1           | 101         | 2025-04-30     | 2025-05-01   |
| 2           | 102         | 2025-04-29     | 2025-04-29   |
