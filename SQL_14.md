## Question:

Provide the name for each region for every order, as well as the account name and the unit price they paid (`total_amt_usd / total`) for the order.  
However, you should only provide the results if the **standard order quantity exceeds 100**.  
Your final table should have **3 columns**:  
- Region name  
- Account name  
- Unit price  

To avoid a division by zero error, it's helpful to add **`0.01` to the denominator**, like so:  
`total_amt_usd / (total + 0.01)`

## Answer:

```sql

SELECT 
    r.name AS region, 
    a.name AS accountname, 
    o.total_amt_usd / (o.total + 0.01) AS unit_price
FROM region r
JOIN sales_reps s
  ON r.id = s.region_id
JOIN accounts a 
  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN orders o 
  ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE standard_qty > 100 
  AND poster_qty > 50;
```



### Question 15 

Determine the number of times a particular channel was used in the `web_events` table for each region.  
Your final table should have **three columns**:  
- the **region name**,  
- the **channel**, and  
- the **number of occurrences**.  

Order your table with the **highest number of occurrences first**.

---

### Answer:

```sql
SELECT r.name, w.channel, COUNT(*) AS num_events
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
  ON a.id = w.account_id
JOIN sales_reps s
  ON s.id = a.sales_rep_id
JOIN region r
  ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name, w.channel
ORDER BY num_events DESC;
```

### Question 16 

What was the smallest order placed by each account in terms of total usd. Provide only two columns - the account name and the total usd. Order from smallest dollar amounts to largest.

---

### Answer:

```sql
SELECT a.name, MIN(total_amt_usd) smallest_order
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.name
ORDER BY smallest_order;

```
###  Question 16

In which month of which year did Walmart spend the most on gloss paper in terms of dollars?


``` sql 

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', o.occurred_at) ord_date, SUM(o.gloss_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o 
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
WHERE a.name = 'Walmart'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;


```

### Question 17 

 This time, create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time with no date truncation. 
 Your final table should have two columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.

###Answer: 

```sql

SELECT standard_amt_usd,
SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (partition by date_trunc('month',occurred_at ) ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders

```

### Question  18 

Use the accounts table to create first and last name columns that hold the first and last names for the primary_poc.


```sql

select 
 primary_poc,
 left(primary_poc, POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as firstname,
 right(primary_poc, length(primary_poc)-POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as lastname
                     
from  accounts 

```


### Question 19 
Now see if you can do the same thing for every rep name in the sales_reps table. Again provide first and last name columns.


```sql
select 
 name ,
 left(name, POSITION (' ' in  name ))as firstname,
 right(name, length(name)-POSITION (' ' in  name ))as lastname
                     
from  sales_reps 
```
### Question 20 

Each company in the accounts table wants to create an email address for each primary_poc. The email address should be the first name of the primary_poc . last name primary_poc @ company name .com.



```sql
with  t1 as 
( 
 select 
 name ,
 left(primary_poc, POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as firstname,
 right(primary_poc, length(primary_poc)-POSITION (' ' in  primary_poc ))as lastname
                     
from  accounts  

)
      
select 
  CONCAT(firstname,'.',lastname,'@',Replace(name, ' ', ''),'.com' ) as email 
  from t1 
       
```
)

	when last_year.chrun < current_year.churn then 'increase'
        else 'no change'
	end as chnage_indicator

### Question 18 

Q.

	Find the best-selling item for each month (no need to separate months by year) where the biggest total invoice was paid.  
	The best-selling item is calculated using the formula (unitprice * quantity ). Output the description of the item along with the amount paid. 

Your output should include:

	the month (use DATE_TRUNC('month', invoicedate)),
	the description of the best-selling item, 
	and the total amount paid.
