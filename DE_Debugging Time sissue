# 1. Generate Time vs Processing Time

- **Generate time** is when data is created.
- **Processing time** is when data is processed by your pipeline.  
- 📌 *Note: Every pipeline has its own processing time.*

---

# 2. Pipeline Run Time vs Execution Time

- **Execution time** represents the time for the data to be processed.
- **Run time** represents the actual time the pipeline was run.
- Example: Your pipeline can run at 1 AM every morning and process data from the prior day.  
- ⚠️ *Note: Do not use `datetime.now()` as the execution time.*

---

# 3. Store in UTC & View in Local Timezone

- Store time data as **UTC** to ensure consistent analytics.
- When visualizing in a UI, **convert to the local timezone**.
- Data processing and debugging often require toggling between UTC and local time.

---

# 4. Use ISO8601 Format for Dates

- Use `YYYYMMDD` (ISO8601 standard) for dates.
- Can be stored as **integers** for simplicity.
- Enables **proper sorting and range filtering**.

---

# 5. Understand Time Data Types

- Most databases support:
  - `DATE`
  - `TIME`
  - `TIMESTAMP`
- Use `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` where supported to store timezone-aware data.

---

# 6. Epoch Time

- Epoch time = Number of seconds since **Jan 1, 1970 UTC**
- Advantages:
  - Single number to represent time
  - Simplifies time arithmetic
- Limitations:
  - Not human-readable
- Use `to_timestamp()` functions in SQL or code to convert for display.

---

# 7. Time Travel

- See how data looked **at a specific point in the past**
- Previously required tracking both event and processing times
- Now available as a built-in **feature in modern table formats** (e.g., Delta Lake, Iceberg, Hudi)

---

📌 **Final Note**:  
Data processing is tightly coupled with time. Design your systems with **temporal awareness** to enable flexibility, accuracy, and reproducibility.
